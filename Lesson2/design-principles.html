        Simply Chocolate has one of the most beautiful and fun websites that I've ever seen! It's amazingly interactive and images, colors, and products change as you scroll, even a little. No matter where you're at on their site, it's obvious they thought about how they want the page to read, as there is a clear visual hierarchy on each page. The less important the information is, the smaller it is. Helpful images and text are large throughout, and it makes for a website that is exceptionally user friendly and easy to read.

        Paper Planes is a gorgeous, clean, and streamlined website that allows you to digitally make and throw paper airplanes from your phone. You can catch planes that others have created and thrown, and see where they've been in the world before throwing it back. They use clean fonts and simple colors, with unlined graphics and a lot of whitespace to create that simplistic and modern feel that makes their site a breath of fresh air.

        RESN's I Spy site was created to teach kids about beautiful places around New Zealand. They keep their branding consistent no matter what page you're on by using the same type of graphics, similar colors, as well as cohesive fonts. It's fun and interactive, and still gives you a feel for New Zealand and the variety of it's natural beauty.
